            In terms of programming, I created the system that, when a player shoots an object, the object will shoot out particles of the same color to sell the idea of destroying the environment with the gun. I also worked on some of the bossesâ€™ behaviors.<br><br>
            For level design, the game is a parody in its essence, and so the approach was to exaggerate the layout of a real courtroom. Rooms were made to be much bigger, increasing in size as the player progressed; this was a light metaphor to how small the player was against the judicial system, but it was also made to use day-to-day objects in a more creative way.<br> For example, the last level is a bathroom inside the court building, and so the bathtub goes from being a normal object to a massive lake. The layout of the level was also designed to make the player have more enemy encounters by segmenting some areas or creating corridors that lead to hostile zones.

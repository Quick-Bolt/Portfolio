            In terms of programming, I was tasked with creating the shield system. The shield system worked as follows: the player a shield that rotates around them and is controlled by the middle mouse button.<br> When an enemy bullet hits this shield, it reflects the bullet based on the angle it hits the shield while also taking into account the curvature of the shield.<br><br>
            In terms of visuals, I created the USB stick car that the player controls.

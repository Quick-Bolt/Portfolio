            In terms of network, I was tasked with programming everything required for the multiplayer; this included: the players being able to enter a lobby and then the game; players picking up/using objects and syncing that with everyone else playing; players being able to interact with each other and making sure there was no latency and that the systems worked properly with VR.<br><br>
            The level was procedurally generated but based on pre-built chunks; this was done so that the maze would always be different in each playthrough but also so that we could control some aspects of the level.<br> My task when creating the chunks was to promote players encountering each other. Because it was a maze and players started in different areas, there could be a chance that they never met; however, the chunks were designed to encourage player interactions as they were often connected to other chunks and had corridors in themselves that would lead to the chunk middle, or sometimes, a chunk would have 2 possible inner destinations.<br><br> The level also had 3 main zones: one exterior, one in the middle, and a final zone. As zones progressed towards the middle, there were more and more chunks that led to common areas.<br> Finally, there was also a key that the players had to find in the maze to open the exit, and this key would also be spawned in chunks that connected major areas so as to make players run into each other.

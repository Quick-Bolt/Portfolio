            For level design, the goal was to give the eerie feel of being in the ocean depths while also factoring in the controls the player had with the submarine.<br><br>
            To achieve this, the first area is mostly open with a few obstacles that the player must avoid; the objective was to let the player get familiar with the submarine controls. Between the first and second areas, there’s a narrow entryway that leads to a trench; this introduces verticality to the level layout and teaches the player to use pitch and buoyance controls inside the submarine to explore more than in just one plane of movement.<br> The second area is a dense kelp forest with low visibility; here the goal was to teach the player to use the sonar of the submarine. <br>Afterwards, the player goes into a narrow canyon with tight turns and passageways; this area challenges the player’s ability to control the submarine. Next there’s a coral habitat with large corals where the player must use the vertical controls of the submarine to its maximum to traverse.<br><br>
             Finally, to keep the theme of an open area going into a tighter one, we lead the player through a slender ravine that leads to a final, more open area with a boss.

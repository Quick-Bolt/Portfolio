            In terms of programming, I developed the main systems for the game, namely enemies spawning in waves, different types of enemies with varied behavior, and placing down towers.<br><br>
            In terms of level design, the levels were made with the concept of having branching paths and entryways for enemies, which made gameplay more exciting and added fair difficulty to it.<br><br>
            In terms of visuals, I created the cutscenes in-between stages using Photoshop.

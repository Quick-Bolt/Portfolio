            This was a project I made for the company “Pesquisa e Métodos." It was created in C#.<br> It was a webscraper that would obtain specific information from a website, organize it, and place it in a database. The database was also connected to an Excel sheet, so cross-checking between the scrapped information and the Excel sheet was possible, as was adding or changing items in the Excel sheet based on the new information obtained.

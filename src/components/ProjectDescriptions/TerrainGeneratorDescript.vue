            In this project, a custom perlin noise function was created; this function would take in octaves, frequency, amplitude, and grid size to output a noise texture. Using this, vertexes of a quad were displaced to create a realistic looking terrain.<br> The noise was modifiable, and so different variations were made to create clouds, water reflections, grass placement, and planets with different visual effects.<br> I also created the fog which is customizable and increases in density depending on camera distance.

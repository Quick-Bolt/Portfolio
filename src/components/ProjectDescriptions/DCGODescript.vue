            For this project, I am tasked with programming card mechanics, each card can have unique effects, which means I need to be able to constantly adapt. <br><br>
            The process for creating a card starts with creating a scriptable object for it, filling it with the necessary information like its name or card number and then creating a C# script that goes with it. The code logic is usually segmented in parts, as each card can also have effects with different timings of action. I must analyze the intended effect of each card, determine the necessary checks to ensure its execution, and identify any potential interdependencies with other behaviors. Thereafter, I implement the logic for the effect itself. <br><br>
            The effects are numerous but here’s some examples: when a card is played, reveal x number of cards from the deck; when a card attacks, first interact with the player board (for example destroying one of their cards or returning them to their hand); when a card is destroyed, use some of its resources to play something else.<br> There are also effects that tend to activate while others are happening, for example “blast digivolve” is an effect that activates while your opponent is attacking you. Having this said, my work in this project mostly revolves around finding ways to create new effects while keeping in mind that the game can either be online or played against an AI.<br><br>
            I also do bug fixes for card logic of other cards that need to be repaired.

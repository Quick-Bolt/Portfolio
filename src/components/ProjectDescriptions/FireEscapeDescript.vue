            In terms of level design, the approach I took was based on a few variables: firstly, for the setting, the game was located inside an office floor, so rooms like storage areas, work areas, bathrooms, and meeting areas were used as the available regions in the level.<br><br>
            Secondly, in terms of layout, the level was to change a bit every playthrough to break monotony. However, there was still a design aspect that went into it; just changing the level completely randomly wouldn’t work as well. The layout was designed to always make the start and exit be at opposite ends of the level, and in between, the corridors leading the player were made to both disorient the player, sometimes leading to another room or sometimes to a dead end, but at the same time were made to make the player pass through multiple rooms to reach the exit.<br> The goal was to lure the players into spending time in these rooms; inside these rooms, there were collectibles only placed there to waste the player’s time, as the objective was to escape the building as quickly as possible. This was made to teach players about the importance of not wasting time collecting belongings but to escape fast when in a real fire.<br><br>
            For particle effects, I did the fire extinguisher smoke and fire effects.
